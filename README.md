play-paste
==========

A ridiculus stupid implementation of a Paste service written in Scala (Play) that uses hbase as backend.

Why? Because there was a bet with a colleague of mine at the time on the most stupid in requirement service we could come up with.

The code somehow is really small. I guess I've lost.
